            <h1>Hanbing Wang</h1>
            <p>As a practicing artist focusing on Chinese classical aesthetics, I combine computer technology with traditional Chinese art to place artistic criticism within the context of Oriental aesthetics. I create a hazy, poetic atmosphere using classical Chinese imagery, and within this poetic world, I explore the fundamental emotions and spiritual dimensions of human beings. I reflect on the possibilities of Chinese classical thought in the face of contemporary life and ultimately shift my attention to the fate of all humanity. </p> 
            <p>As a researcher at the intersection of human-computer interaction and cultural heritage, my primary focus is on embodied interaction design for conveying aesthetic experiences within the context of cultural heritage. My current research project involves translating language and text in classical Chinese poetry into bodily aesthetics. My goal is to create an immersive interactive environment that combines a sense of embodiment, situational awareness, and virtual reality to restore the cultural domain of China's indigenous cultural heritage. I aim to enable participants to experience the continuity and integrity of their aesthetic experiences through physical engagement, thereby achieving the transmission of Chinese classical aesthetics. My specific practice is to translate classical Chinese poetry texts into body language through embodied interaction, facilitating the understanding of aesthetic content from regional texts in cross-cultural contexts.</p>
            <p>Art is the most sacred discipline. It is meaningful form, a lie that tells the truth, and an eternal aspect of life. To me, art is almost a divine exploration, where creators devote their lives to practicing and refining their craft, establishing their own aesthetic systems, and ultimately becoming true individuals. I am gradually freeing myself from inner turmoil under its influence and achieving harmony.</p>
            <p>I am grateful for the vast and profound Chinese culture. As my creative work deepens, I increasingly realize that a strong sense of Oriental origin and self-consciousness not only manifests in my artistic style but is also deeply rooted in my creative themes, permeating every inch of my skin and bone marrow. Just like ancient poetry, a few simple words, without explicitly stating or explaining, create an artistic conception that is enough to touch millions of people over thousands of years.</p>
