            <h1>Ink Waterfall 墨瀑</h1>
            <p>梅兰竹菊。</p> 
            <p>Combining traditional Chinese ink painting with digital technology, the four plants with traditional Chinese symbolism - plum blossom, orchid, bamboo and chrysanthemum (梅兰竹菊) - are painted in falling splashes of ink and combined with calligraphy and traditional Chinese poetry.</p>

                <p>"Plum, Orchid, Bamboo and Chrysanthemum (梅兰竹菊) " is a traditional subject in Chinese painting, and since ancient times the Chinese have used these four plants to illustrate the noble character of the gentleman. The splashes of ink are also a classic element of Chinese painting. I have attempted to combine these two elements using digital technology, thus exploring a digital aesthetic approach that combines both traditional meaning and technological sensibility.
                <!-- <p>Modern linguistics argues that the cognitive faculties of human beings make vague distinctions between classes, which makes it difficult for them to define and represent objective things accurately in language. The limitations of language itself tend to obscure meaning, and the denotative act it performs is a modification, a reduction or expansion of what is intuitive, showing the result of a mutation, and thus a "breakage" and a "blank" between language and the thing it refers to. This strong questioning of language coincides with Zen Buddhism. The "No Establishment of Words" is an important aspect of Zen Buddhism, where Zen masters believe that "Words are Empty" and advocate a way of communicating and comprehending Zen theory that is free from the concept of language. -->
                <!-- <p>In the work No Establishment of Words, the Calligraphic Texts from the Heart Sutra are framed in their momentary state as they peel off, while leaving hollowed out marks on the wooden panel. When these flaking texts are lit, the smoke from the burning wood is detected by the smoke sensor on top of the board and light comes through the hollowed-out area, appearing as a sutra text, with the intensity of the light varying positively according to the concentration of smoke. -->
